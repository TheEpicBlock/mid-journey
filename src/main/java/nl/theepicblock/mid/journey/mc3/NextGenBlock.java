/**
 * Just like web3 revolutionized the web, mc3 will revolutionize minecrafting.
 * The {@link NextGenBlock} contains a modern re√Ømagining of what it means for a block to
 * exist, which is compatible with the core values of mc3.
 * <p>
 * For backwards compatibility, {@link NextGenBlock} extends the legacy mc1 {@link Block} interface. Note that
 * these methods are intended for legacy compatibility only: we at Mid Journey believe that {@link NextGenBlock}
 * contains all the tools necessary to make a blazingly fast block. In the future, support for legacy {@link Block}
 * methods might be removed entirely in favour of the tools contained in {@link NextGenBlock}.
